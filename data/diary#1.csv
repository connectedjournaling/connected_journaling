the-end-of-the-world-(as-i-know-it)#blue        "11/04/2009 - 22/12/2012She called me the immediate following day after DOOMSDAY telling me that our love has spoiled. That i am strong and i must forget her and our moments. That she found a new love and she has new dreams with him. That she loves him and she won't do the same thing that she did to me (to leave him behind for me). That i am the devil and he is a good guy the absolute opposite than me. That although we had wonderful sex life he does better sex than me. That she will remember our days together for the rest of her life as good memories. And she will be wishing for me the best.Well i have only few things to say...FUCK YOU ""M"". GO DROWN WITH HIM IN A POOL FULL OF SHIT. THIS WORLD WILL BE SAVED WITHOUT YOU. THIS LIFE IS FUCKING BETTER WITHOUT YOUR MISERABLE FAKE ANGEL-FACE AND THE GLITTERING OF YOUR EYES. IT'S MY FUCKING FAULT BUILDING DREAMS WITH YOU FOR US AND TRYING MAKE YOU A BETTER PERSON. IT'S MY FUCKING FAULT SACRIFICING MYSELF FOR YOU FLYING LIKE A HUNTED ONE TO CATCH PLANES TO YOUR HOMEPLACE SO AS TO SEE YOU EVEN FOR A FEW HOURS DURING MY DAYS-OFF AND THEN BE BACK FLYING AGAIN. NO MATTER HOW YOUR FUCKING BODY CHANGES YOUR HEAD AND MIND WILL BE THE SAME SHIT AS ALWAYS WAS FROM THE VERY FUCKING BEGINNING TO THIS FUCKING END.THE DAY SHALL COME THAT YOU WILL REALIZE WHO AND WHAT THE FUCK I HAD BEEN ALL THESE YEARS FOR YOU AND US. BUT IT WILL BE FUCKING TOO LATE FOR YOU. EITHER I WILL BE 1 BILLION MILES AWAY OR I WILL BE FUCKING DEAD. I DON'T FUCKING CARE. YOU PRESSED THE RED BUTTON OF DESTRUCTION. AND NOW I AM FUCKING DEAD. MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY.BUT BEHOLD... I AM RISING AGAIN FROM MY FUCKING ASHES LIKE A PHOENIX.AND AGAIN FINALLY. F U C K Y O U."
1-year-black-anniversary#blue   One year passed without you. One terrible black and empty year. On 1st January i am entering Jesus' year. There are moments that i am walking on the streets travelling by plane sitting somewhere thinking of our past moments that now just do haunt me. There has been moments that i've been near to your places to our places. Even a few meters away from your home. I don't know truly what kind of feelings are inside of me about you anymore. Sometimes i am afraid to meet you again. Sometimes i am angry. Sometimes i am depressed. Sometimes i feel lonely. And sometimes i truly wish i never met you.I have this feeling that the time shall come that we will meet again. I feel that on 1st January you will be thinking of me. Maybe you are already too far away and too fucked up to even approach back to our past. Sometimes i do have the fear that maybe you will come back to my place and do whatever shit comes to your mind. Sometimes i do feel that you will search for me or ask any of my relatives or friends or whatever the fuck you can imagine to figure out what's happening with me.One thing is for sure. I don't want you to know anything about me. You left me stranded. Our moments are orphaned anymore. I am the only one who do keep them warm and colorful. Sometimes i want to cry thinking of them. Sometimes i want to curse you. And some other times when this time comes that we shall meet again i just want to pass away in front of your eyes. Like a stranger. Like someone you have never met. Like a ghost. Like a dead figure that is walking with the living. If you ever dare to talk to me i only want to place my finger on my lips and transfer silently my only words left to say. Shut up. Fuck you.
crossroad-possibility#blue      "Some weeks ago i went to the harbor to send some stuff to my brother by ship. After i finished that task while i was going away i turned my head to the right. I saw a red motorbike similar like yours. I saw a girl with your body sculpture similar like you holding a packet trying to lift it up. She was wearing similar black helmet like yours. You were doing the same shit all the time when we were together (to wear your helmet while you were doing some stuff). I also think i saw that sissy-boy of yours with her. One million thoughts crossed my mind same way like blood is diluting in water. But i didn't approach. Nor stopped to stare and be sure. I just continued going away hoping you didn't see me nor recognize me. It would be my worst nightmare to meet you again after all this shit happened.It's a world full of endless possibilities. Full of chances. Full of similarities and differences. I also might have been hallucinating at that time. It could be you. Or some other girl who might be similar to you. But too many similarities. Plus the ship that could take you to your homeland that unfortunately is the same to my homeland. I feel ashamed to be with you. It dishonors the land i am coming from. It makes me feel stink and disgust. I am sure. I hate you. I really hate you. But mostly i hate myself wasting all this time with you.Some days ago i heard one phrase; ""Don't try to hate the person you loved once you will only find out that you shall love her more"". Possibly it's just bullshit. But could be also the bitter truth.I have only one thing more to say;""On taottava silloin kun rauta on kuuma""(it's a small riddle to translate it in English. Might be useful for everyone who read this plus everything from me. Small hint; original language is Finnish)And finally. Again. FUCK YOU ""M"""
bloody-roots#blue       "I am again back to my homeland. Although my trip was unexpected and happened due to family reasons i walked again through our past. The bus station where we gave our first kiss. The streets where you were driving your motorbike and going to the seaside even during late autumn nights of 2011 holding just a towel and you. Teasing you by speeding up from behind and hearing you screaming. I even passed by very near to the house where you and your parents lived. So many memories that are dead for you and alive for me. So many moments together that your present ""happy life"" with your ""Italian Stallion"" made them forgotten. They are now ghosts piercing me and my heart all the time while i am walking through this city.I learned something new today. That you dyed your hair blonde. Horrible. Now you are placed in an even worse location and characterization inside of me. A worthless and dumb version of yourself lost into the wonders of a fake money life shopping in fancy stores fake ""friends"" and eventually diminished into the useless spaces of FB and G . A fantastic plastic virtual world where you deserve to be. A fake existence into a constructed and useless plain that you imagine as happiness.Today i prayed to the church near my village trying to cleanse my wounds and bad feelings. But no result. I feel pity for you and him. And despite my strongest efforts to forget you and keep you away from me i hate you even more than before. But most of all i hate myself for losing my heart feelings emotions love touch and most of all time for being with you. I regret with all my inner-self all these years i lost with you for you. I hate you so much. I wish there could be a way to delete these moments that i lived and never met you but keep everything else with me. I hate you."
tuleen-ajettu-maa...#blue       Just a random search... and a child came out...some words of yours saying about going to a kind of a kinder-garden during the end of October 2013 with a small girl... Cold & chilling blood ran through my veins. You already have a daughter?! I remember our dreams having 2 children together Natalia and Angel. Now these dreams are orphaned too. Like our life has passed to a crossroad and now are separated forever. Vanished and lost.I am frozen now. Feeling dead. Like time has stopped. Like nothing has meaning anymore. I don't know what to do. How to react. From the first side i just want to stand still and frozen looking far away. From another side i just want to cry. Cry so much and then die.Why am i so attached? She had her purpose. Find someone and do her own things no matter who this man would be. Ignoring even our wishes. Letting everything die and go away with the first available man on her way.I am still at the place where we met where we first kissed where we made love where our strongest moments were written.And now everything is gone. Lost. Dead. Forgotten.Can't believe what i just found out. Fuck.A land driven into fire. And i am still standing there...
worst-mistake-of-my-life...#blue        "On 11th April 2009 at around this time i made the worst mistake of my life. I arrived at the bus station of my hometown met you and kissed you. It was the beginning of my own fall. My sentence for an unknown crime that i have done during my life. 5 years gone and the memory of mine is still alive like if it happened just today. Memories that you probably have forgotten (or maybe let aside to your brainless head). Promises that were never kept true. A fake love. A fake relationship. A submission to just precious lost time.I cannot forget one thing most of all. When things were good to my life you were telling me the greatest bullshit promises and feelings from your idiotic mouth. When things went difficult the only thing you did was to abandon the ship and leave with your ""Italian Stallion"". I feel such shame such regret and most of all so much pity of myself that i lost all this life with you.I will never forget your betrayal no matter how many years will pass. No matter what shall happen to my life. It's another black anniversary written on my tombstone.I want revenge. Don't worry. The best revenge in life is a dish eaten deeply frozen at the most unexpected time. Don't worry. I am not intending to kill you. Nor do something illegal. I am not even intending to even see you again nor meet you. Your own miserable self and life will give you the proper punishment for what you have done to me.I have told you something once. You shall remember me when it's going to be too late for you. When your Stallion becomes someone whom you will not be satisfied from. When your parents shall continue their disrespect towards your own actions. When you shall understand my value my sacrifices and my own everything that i gave you and taught you. It will be like a huge black hole consuming you. Realizing that what you have been doing is a huge lie. A huge emptiness to your own initial emptiness.I am literally sure that during such moments you shall wish that you were dead. But hey. You will be alive and suffering. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Only your own self.And again. Shut up. FUCK YOU."
erittain-vihainen#blue  "I was walking on the street. Although spring has come some random thoughts about you and us passed by inside of my head as usual. Huge emotions and countless moments together that marked my life forever and my heart indefinitely. I felt like a huge black hole was consuming me. Like a black wavy ocean was pulling me inside under a bloody full moon. Such thoughts are consuming me most of the time while I'm thinking of our past.Sometimes i feel i am possessed of my sadness from the loss of what we had. Sometimes i feel pity for myself. Sometimes i am just blank like time has stopped and everything has erased. Sometimes i am crying. Sometimes i am angry and furious. Sometimes i am just wondering. And finally sometimes i realize that the more time is passing by the more i hate you for what you have done to me and to what we had.I am hurt badly and indefinitely. Like I'm crippled or incapacitated. It's unbearable. But most of the times i am just shutting up my fucking mouth and trying to keep myself up and standing. Bearing all this enormous monster that is eating me from inside. The more I'm saying ""be patient"" the more i get enraged and transforming into a huge red beast ready to destroy.This week that begins today is called ""Great Week"" in our orthodox religion. It symbolizes the torturing death and resurrection of our savior Jesus Christ. I feel so ashamed that i can't go on living my life without you. I feel so miserable for my weakness. I can't follow his path of love by forgiving you. I can't. I just can't. I hate you so much. I have never ever hated someone that much in my entire life. I am imagining you with your Stallion wishing for each other through your bullshit relationship and i want to puke. Only the image of such thing happening in front of my eyes makes me feel disgust first of all for myself and then for you. This hate is so enormous that i deeply wish you to live the worst Easter of your life.I am so fallen. So ashamed. So desperate. So lost..."
musta-paholaiset...#blue        Black Devils...Today you are celebrating and tomorrow you are celebrating your birthday. I am giving tremendous and enormous fights to get rid of you from my head from my mind from my thoughts from my feelings and eventually from my heart. I even can't believe that after so long time from the moment i last saw you my feelings remain so strong. So vivid. So tough. So bad.I feel like i am betraying myself. My current life. Even my religion. At some points i even believe i am losing my sanity and patience. Your loss and the amount of anger that i feel look like a thousand devils covered with black purple and red clouds all around them haunting me. Drinking my own blood. Laughing at me and taunting me. Enjoying my misery and pain. There are truly moments that i feel i am possessed or something. Maybe i really am.I want to call you and swear to you the worst words i can ever imagine. To yell at you and throw out all this pain i have inside me like flames ignited with aircraft fuel. I am trying to relax and forget. It's impossible. The more time passes by the more i get mad furious and frustrated. I do blame myself for fucking everything around me including my life. I need to study and i can't. I need to go on and prepare myself for my new life away from here and I'm still stuck in this shit. It's my sole blame and fault for this.What am i more puzzled and questioned about is how the fuck did you just erase everything about us with the press of a button. All your emotions. All your feelings. All our moments together. All our life together. I want to do the fucking same. Absolutely the fucking same thing. To fall asleep and wake up like you never existed in my life. Like if i was free or with another woman in my dumpster life.I am waiting for the moment when all this pain shall be transformed to something positive. When all this mess shall be tidied up. When all this loss will be just a faraway glance that i shall tell goodbye to. When all this hell i am living deep inside me shall be heaven again.Until then... SHUT UP. FUCK YOU.
monsterit#blue  Today i made a random search about you. I found you in almost every social network extremely easily and without any effort at all. It's even not necessary for me to be a part of any social network to find everything about you. It's at least remarkably amazing how people can be so desperate and lost themselves in bullshit like these. I never expected that you would be lost in them too. Unfortunately i proved myself mistaken to this too. You are everywhere.I do understand and realized how miserable i am. I admit this. Fully and without any hesitation nor step back. You are what you are. But i am worse. At least i understood one more thing; Every day that passes by gives me more and more reasons to stop feeling for you. To stop loving you. To stop keeping you in my mind and feelings. To realize how useless and lost you are and furthermore that there is nothing anymore valuable to being with you again. Nor see you. Nor remember our past affair. Delete and erase all my memories with you. Like if i have lost my mind. Like if i have lost my memory. Like if i had never been near to you. Love you. Feel for you. Try my best for you.Like everything has died all around me. Moments like today remind me of monsters consuming me. To never land...
mothership-gone...#blue 18-08-2014 - The blackest day of my life. Mothership gone Mothership lost Mothership is faraway now. Rest well. Have a nice trip up in the skies and heavens. May god forgive your sins. I miss you every day that passes by and it hurts so much.I am close to the end of the greatest efforts i am applying to earn my future in Finland. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow things will be finally judged out. I hope this trip shall change my perspective and my future outcome. Fortunately and eventually by myself anymore. Without you. On my own. With my own strength and stamina.Someday you told me that you love me. But you owe me some hope. You were telling me not to let you go and love only you. But you are scattering like the clouds and you are singing whispering to my ears.Shut up. Fuck you...
olen-surullinen-suomessa...#blue        I am in Finland since Saturday October 4th... renewed my Cabin Crew license successfully hoping now for a place up in the skies...I miss my mother a lot. Since her death on August 18th the whole world around me seems so small so insignificant so grey.Weather here is cold and cloudy temperature around zeroes and minuses...Something extraordinary happened that triggered me and rendered me feel bad and sad too. My friend's baby was playing with a doll and left it alone lying on the pavement. When i took it from there i looked at it. My heart almost broke i almost burst into tears. I tried with my greatest efforts not to cry and anyone realizes around me what i really feel. I placed the doll with care on a small shelf to the left where my bed is. When i look at it i remember my ex. She was all the time telling me that she wants to get married and have a baby. Maybe that's why she left me. Again i don't consider this as a reason why to leave somebody who you love away. The pain is bad. Really bad. It pierces me like acid arrow entering my heart. Maybe i do understand her feelings for the first time in my life. Maybe i am just thinking bullshit or i am so emotionally filled that i give some kind of forgiveness and reason why she did this to me. Maybe she was just a bitch and i am just such an idiot now.On Saturday i am coming back to my homeland. Finally i do realize that even 5000km away i am still thinking of her. That eventually this trouble is not going away that easy. I miss her so much. I'm such an idiot...
2-years-black-anniversary#blue  Two years have gone away without you. 2014 was without any doubt one of the worst years of my life. Although i got back some things i lost even more. Hopefully i didn't meet you nor heard anything about you. I am happy about that. The pain now comparing to 2013 is lesser but still exists. My true inner wish says that i should never meet you again. Nor hear any news about you. Like if you are dead. This will roll me down to the bottom again. I am trying my best to avoid any pathways that could increase such chance. Nor walk around to your neighborhood or similar places. Not even to places where we sat together eating or having a coffee. This is my inner goal. And i hope destiny won't crash me to you anymore.
en-tied&auml;-mit&auml;-tehd&auml;...#blue      I'm in deep shit. This winter is silent yet a very strong pain in the ass. Situations here are silent and quiet but it seems it's this way before the big storm arrives. I am hoping for some kind of miracle to dig out from my grave of silence and internal loneliness. To be placed back to where i really belong. Back to the skies...A good thing is happening in the background. Luckily i think i am forgetting you. My rage is finally fading away. I do start to feel that i don't care anymore about your reasonless existence in this world. Eventually i do understand that i should feel grateful that this story of us didn't meant to be. Luckily...
historian-lopussa!-tai...%3f#blue       Back again after a year of absence...2015 was a massively mixed year full of surprises new situations a temporary place up in the scandinavian skies and hopefully (and luckily) your absence. I didn't even sense anything about you or from you at any time during this wandering risky businesses not even around your homeland nor place you used to live.Of course i avoided the bitter-sweet bait to even dare approaching some of your possible places that could even slightly increase the possibility of crashing you. Thankfully this has never happened yet not at least sensed it nor realized it in any way.For sure everybody who is reading this is sure that i haven't forgotten you. Of course your fucking curse is still crawling inside of me reminding me like flashes of cold blood and poison our moments together.Eventually these moments are now less frequent and in less significance comparing to the past years. It's been pretty long time since i last saw you physically somewhere. You might have seen me. Even with another girl. I don't care. It would be a pleasure if it happened though...Of course your fucking pathetic existence still walks inside every kind of SM around the globe. I still don't exist there. Nor i am planning to do so at all eventually. For me what counts is 100% real life. No fake net shit. No SM. Nothing of these crap. I like this idea knowing you will never see me this way. Not even know what the hell i am up to or thinking in there. You know fucking nothing. And i am glad about it.During this year i have spoken at very random times about you and to very few people. I know that i still feel bitter. All my words reflects this. Like a dark sun. Like a blue moon. It's something that i want to forget and erase 100% from the deepest parts of me. A graceful salvation. A flying release flying away and never look back.2016 is going to be an enormous year. Really conflicting but yet surprisingly amazing. I can't wait to see what's coming up next in here.So... In the end of history! Or...?
menetetty#blue  There is an uncertain kind of serenity happening in here. A fake feeling for the deep darker inside of me. Still seeking my place up in the skies no good result until now...There are some points of time that i am still seeking what the fuck you have been doing. And of course what else you have become a social media craving s... - The worst thing is that i am still fucking myself without any obvious reason. It has been more than 3 years ago since i last saw your fucking face and faced your damn shitty existence. Sometimes i do believe that my world is literally fucked up into fragments like a defense-type grenade explosion has happened and all my pieces are scattered all around like birds' shit. This thing must change.I am lost but at least i am seeking for something real that will eventually help me forget you and erase all shit from this timeline.Who knows... maybe one day i shall wake up or see you in the street and realize why the fuck was i thinking of you and wasting my time thoughts and feelings for you. I might spit you right to your face or ignore you completely.As i found out the most difficult part is becoming a stranger to a person you used to love more than your life. Definitely the good captain is the last man standing inside the storm. Let's see what shall eventually win. My darkness or my path to enlightenment...
yksi-plussa-yksi=nolla#blue     All alone under a black painted sky. Inside of a building that's empty but full of memories. People lost love's lost. Mothership's gone. Despite my choices i feel like a huge black hole is consuming me day by day. But this is not misery nor depression. The difficulty of going back up to the skies is killing me. It's so hard to keep it stable. Sometimes it feels so unstable like a waiter trying to hold his tray full of glasses during an earthquake.And you... you are just a distant voice like a distress in my head. I think i have found the way to keep myself away forever. Might be for the best. Or the worst. Or even both. Who knows? Who cares anyway...
lennan-korkealla!!!#blue        "At last. The circle has been completed. The page has turned. The spirit has been reincarnated. The dream IS true and alive!I am one step away from my big step high up to the skies! Only some typical paperwork is missing and then i am gone...Hopefully you are a ghost anymore. There are almost no moments existing that i am thinking of you. As a matter of fact... there is somebodyelse who has taken your place. Yep. It happened. And despite the fact that i may fail with her... i don't mind!She does have the dilemma right through her head ""should i run to him? or not?"" Time will reveal the answer. I have completed all my moves that are denoting to her side. The ball of choice is right into her field at this time. Few days more remaining...For all of you reading this... YES dreams DO come true. YES you can forget someone who has hurt you in the past. YES the page CAN turn.Dedicated to the mothership who brought me into this world. Be blessed and kind wherever you are. Soon i shall be near you. And i know that you are watching me. And like an archangel keeping an eye on me. Love will find you...NEVER SAY DIE! LET'S FLY!!!"
mitä-vittua%3f!%3f!%3f#blue     "The title says it all... thought that I've seen it all... not yet! The agreement that was offered was terrible my decision was not to take it at all. I am absolutely sure that nobody believes me regarding my decision. I don't f... care. I prefer choosing something viable rather than selecting my own sentence to death...The good thing is that I am thinking of another girl that has the exact same name like me. It's a really long story that holds it's roots more than a decade ago but was hidden under the shadows. Who knows... maybe I am just wacko or this is a huge slap on my face to eventually move on emotionally and at least have a serious motivation out there. I am curious to see what shall happen now.So I am still trapped into this dump organizing the miracle that's about to come. No regrets. No sorrows. As Ragnar Lothbrok says; ""Don't waste your time looking back... You are not going that way..."" Totta kai..."
lennan-korkealla-part-ii#blue   Few days ago i had a hard but fantastic training in Spain regarding my profession. Everything ran smoothly and flawlessly all my paperwork is now current and i am just single-digit days away from my place up in the skies...Something unexpected happened during my trip by ship to my homeland... and it is called love...I met a girl onboard who showed lots of interest to me. Long talks during almost the entire night endless discussions about everything. She has the most close characteristics to my dream girl. Tall almost 1.70 natural blonde smiling all the time very dynamic and hard working. Eventually what happened was that she slept into my arms... the best 4 hours of my life. I don't really know what happened or how things went so fast there. I truly wished inside of me that these moments should never end. I smiled again after so many months.I am still trying to understand what is going on... All i know is that i want to be near her all the time make her smile and keep her into my arms sleeping like a baby. Seeing her face glowing and looking at me happy. Listening to all her feelings... I miss her so much...Yep. I am in love.Tomorrow I am planning to go near her hoping that she will steal some time for me (she is working 12 hours every day)...And then... fate?
"""monet-kysymykset         #blue"     "What's the dearest of our walkthrough into our lives? Many questions...Things with this new girl did not go that well. I am almost sure that something's seriously wrong with her. At first i thought that she is strange or unreal but as time passes by her behaviour is somewhat... random. Like a dice is falling and the number that comes is what she is doing eventually...We met in the morning had a quick coffee before her work. She was furious about it. I tried to calm her down and give her some advice how to deal with it. Then she told me ""I read all your feelings about it I am a very difficult person I am not ready for something more"". I told her ""I did not ask anything. It is enough for me to know that you are alright smiling and feeling well with me. I did not come to your life to make it more mess but being besides you"". After we left the place she told me that she is free at 03:00am ""We can meet again no problem"".After that she disappeared completely. Of course I never thought of the idea finding her at her workplace nor going near her house (I know both) that would be too lame. So I let it go...Next morning 3 messages on my cell phone. I told her briefly I am alright. She replied ""I am at work"". Again let it go...She called me after midnight. She told me ""Your words helped me i told them i won't work until 3am again"" i said ""I'm glad to hear that"".Then our conversation rotated regarding my work conditions and priviledges. I was shocked hearing that she didn't remember a thing. Then I told her ""It's no use to feel bad regarding the past. It's gone. Just learn the lessons from it and move on"". She also asked me when Am i leaving abroads. I told her ""end of this month"". ""Will I see you on Sunday?"" She said ""I don't know I am not sure"". She also told me that the night i was waiting for her she was wasting herself in an Internet Cafe listening to YTB and walking around. Then she said kisses and goodnight.Strange experience. I felt like I am lost in Japan or something. Well...Maybe i should write a song called ""Lost In Japan"" or something...Monday will be a tremendous day for me. I shall make a huge move to a girl that i like for more than two years. Also been in a huge relationship like me. I shall visit her after so long time.Overthinking is nothing. Execuring is everything. I hope it goes well. She made my day yesterday by calling me. Can't wait for the moment that i shall grab her and kiss her passionately. I've been waiting so long this moment to come.Future Memories are about to come..................."
turbulentti-virtaus#blue        "Back to the skies... The first part has been completed.Today it was the time of the revelations... When i was at my homeland i did not meet that girl at all. She disappeared completely from the radar. Despite the fact that i searched for her no reply. Just vanished...Until yesterday i was so sad and so desperate. But i had a hidden hope that she would appear back from the shadows. I was right. I got an SMS saying ""I miss you so much... i am in deep $h!t... I am writing to you during lecture... I hope you have a good time up there... many kisses....That was it. I sent her a message telling her that i need to speak to her. She called me after an hour. I confessed everything. All my feelings for her. That i am thinking of her during the last 2 years. How much i love her. A million things more regarding all what i feel about her in about half an hour call.She told me that she loves me. I heard her voice ""feminine"" for the first time in my life. It melted me down.I told her to remember everything. That i am alive for the moment to hug her again.I am so happy and simultaneously feeling so strange. Our story has been extremely strange. I also told her to come near me with all the expenses paid.I hope she shall do what we discussed and hug her the soonest possible.A big and difficult flying day is here to come. Miss her so much...So much turbulence. So much love. So many feelings.............."
pimeyden-pelko#blue     Today i completed one full month away from my birthplace and home... The most difficult side of this story is the fact that after I confessed all my feelings and love to her... now she is flying around the dark side of the moon disappearing from every possible radar...Of course this is not the first time that's happening... but now this kind of agony is agitating. I truly hope that she shall do what must be done by her side and be with her... this time for good.When I feel alone i have her photograph in my phone. This gives me strength and energy to go on and cope with it.Fear of the dark...
vapaa-tila#blue "I feel like a shade into the darkness...Some days ago i went to my homeplace... I thought the idea of doing a final attempt with the girl that i like for so many years ago. Although i sensed it that it would end to a kind of disaster at least i tried my very best....After my arrival i tried to reach her. She was completely vanished. Disappeared. Like a ghost. My calls and messages reached the absolute void.Well... the last thing remaining to do was to try my best so that i could ""accidentally"" meet her. I went to her university hoping that she had some lesson to do. Sat down listening to music. Tears were falling from my eyes. And......................She appeared in front of me. With her boyfriend. Vittu perkele paska ja saatana...................She kissed me twice on my cheeks and left. The kiss of Judas..........................Her boyfriend asked me why am i here. I told him some random bullshit regarding information. He told me to go at their place. At first i thought that i should stay at the uni hoping to find her alone and eventually find an end to this rope. But on the other hand i also thought it was a good idea to gather some extra info...Arrived at their place after some time. He told me by himself everything regarding their terrible financial situation that has been happening for many years. Then listening to random Irish music...And then she arrived. During our time there she told me that she received my photos (oh really??? - at least i found out that she has been reading all my emails...). Then random subjects...............Then she threw me the 1st bomb. She decided to continue her studies for 5 years at my homeplace (meaning that she shall continue her affair - in fact this flipped over what she told me during winter and spring; that she would like to end her current studies faster and move to the capital... 180 degrees turn///)...Then she told me to stand and watch her plants. At that point i wanted to slap her on the face just in case that her brain wakes up. But i said into myself ""leave it... it's not worth it""...She was sitting besides him almost all the time. At some time she touched him in front of me. I think the message was clear at that stage. Dead end.Then we had to go since she had to attend another lesson at the uni. He would also come and be present at her lesson (this proves once more that she is wearing her collar and he is taking her for a walk or smth...). We stayed at the stairs looking at each other while he was seeking his stuff at home. At that point... i wanted to slap her grab her and kiss her passionately. Again my logic point worked more comparing to my emotions. Right move.Then she told me that she will be free after the end of July (who cares...). She hugged me and kissed me again and both of them left...While walking to the bus station i was lost. Reached the shore and thinking this fucking void that i am thrown into... All my feelings were mixed. Anger sadness disappointment. I wanted to stay there and cry all night long. But i took many deep breaths and said into myself ""let it go"".Duty calls. Back to my cell.She is now hovering around the dark side of the moon. Until she shall appear again.Right now i don't know what to do. My logic says to leave and shut this door forever. My heart...... Still loves her. But i can't bear this shit anymore.Only time will tell..."
yksin#blue      A stormy night at the base. Too hot day for this place. Now a big storm is hovering over us and splashing everything making this night into daylight at times.I feel so alone. I am trying to take this situation in a balanced way erase everything that happened and start from scratch. I feel so hurt and so lonely despite the fact that I am back up to the skies...It is so hard to determine my current situation. Maybe I should be more patient and deal with this in a manlier manner. I feel so empty inside. I don't know what I should do.Let it roll. Tomorrow there's more duty to do. Nähdään...
takaisin...#blue        Back to my homeplace for a couple of days. Yesterday that girl contacted me to meet each other for a drink. I told her everything regarding my feelings for her face to face.. She told me that she feels nothing but it can change during the future. She also told me that she feels uncomfortable when I am hugging or touching her. I tried my very best not to hug her or kiss her this was so difficult to do. I really wanted to eat her at that point.Then left to the airport. Back to my shithole again. We shall see what future shall prevail. My mood is neutral now. Maybe I am too sad to have even any kind of feelings at the moment... Listening to Amorphis now. I hope that they are right this time...
samanlainen-tai-erilainen%3f#blue       "Same story... I am surrounded by so many people but still I feel so alone... Today everybody around me became drunk as f... - the result was that I became ""The Mother"" taking everybody to their rooms placing them on their beds to sleep... Eventually I do understand that their lives are so empty and meaningless after all... similar or different?Good question... and the story goes on..."
kaipaan-sinua-(part-i)#blue     "30 to go...Some days ago that previous story ended via sms messages. ""I am in love do not write me again not today and not in the future""It was a shocking experience but at least clarified and eventually thrown into the grave forever...There is another crazy story that is still running after 5-months' pause...One day before my trip to the skies i managed to arrange a date with a girl i met in November 2016 at a party. She was nice smiling and happy. After our date we exchanged some messages. She told me that I gave her positive feelings that she truly needed during that time. Of course she had to continue her studies in Physics also manage her examination semester during that time. Although it was hard I had to accept that I would be far away for so many months and she could not wait for me...Then I tried to approach her via messages during April and May... completely disappeared. At that point I felt it was over...One month ago she appeared suddenly out of nowhere. She called me from her phone and a friend of her spoke on her behalf asking me when i would be back to my home-place and similar stuff. I told her that I was pretty busy and I had a tough roster but I shall try my best soon when summer would reach to it's end...One week before my flight back I wrote to her ""I shall come this day and leave that day. You know where and how to find me"". She replied to me that she wanted to go altogether out with some friends of her that I also knew. I told her ""Good idea but I want to meet you in person without anyone else present"". She agreed and finalized a meeting via sms one day after my arrival...(2 be continued...)"
kaipaan-sinua-(part-ii)#blue    "... So the date was arranged at an amazing cafe that was themed similar to LOTR and to other fantasy stuff... I got her a gift from the skies plus a T-Shirt that had her favourite animal; cats...She appeared in front of me... she was so damn good looking. Her perfume was smelling mixed with her body smell after the gym. My senses and emotions tilted during that time. I can't describe this feeling with words. I wanted her to be mine... 5 months i was hiding in the shadows and nights like a panther. The right time was just there...She was telling me all her stories since the last time we met. Then some stuff regarding aviation. At some point words became more personal regarding what we want in our lives. Then i felt it was the right time to make my move. I told her that I want her to be with me. Straight and plain without side words or any kind of sauces or decorations. We were holding our hands most of the time. She agreed to be with me. Afterwards I saw some tears falling from her eyes. All feelings were mixed also all emotions. But i sensed something was still in the shadows. I tried to kiss her she avoided me. I was shocked. I tried to find an excuse for myself thinking that maybe it was too early for that move. Wish it was like that truly...After 3 hours she told me that she had an appointment with her sister and she left her stranded because of me. We left this place then walking on the street holding hands. During that time I told her that there are 41 days remaining until my operation would end. Then I told her that I would like the following one to do it together. She replied to me ""I don't know"". Of course I knew that it was too early for such kind of conversations. I clarified this thing to her immediately but this was to make her realize that she is somewhat a part of my life and plans too. My heart was a bit chilled at that moment. We agreed that she would call me whenever she could be available. I sent her a nice goodnight message. I got no reply. I thought she was asleep. But still some kind of cockroach was running inside of me. I felt there was something wrong. Time would be the best option to find out..."
vittun-paska#blue       "Fuck it. Today i got probably one of the craziest answers that i have ever read...""Probably my relationship shall be terminated immediately/has ended but it could have not ended. I shall take care from my side to be clear to myself and afterwards my favourite people... this doesn't mean that we will be together even if this that I have now shall come to end. We shall be ""side by side"" for as long as you like because I want that too.""... and then people still think I am the craziest one. Okay. I'm out.16 days remaining to end this fucking shit. What else?"
siivous#blue    10 days remaining for the finale regarding this phase. Next one shall be a good and proper rest followed by a general cleanup defragmentation and refinement of my life including a phone number change plus determining a clear plan for the future and clearing away unnecessary people and/or situations from this point and on. Effective date for this initiation shall be 26th of October to be finalized on November 11th.Definitely and precisely. End of message.
elämä-jatkuu...#blue    "Out of every phase. Cleanup complete. After I came back to my homeplace I went outside her uni waiting for her to see what the hell shall happen with this case. I met some of my brother's friends who do know her and told me that probably she is done with her studies and that she was there many days ago. I thought it was useless to stay anymore and went away. I made some calls of course no answer classic stuff. Days passed by. 52 days complete disappearance. Absolutely nothing like if she's dead killed or smth.After X-mas I wrote an enormous letter telling her everything plus that this is my final and conclusive move. This was my swan song. I wrote to her literally everything regarding how much I love her how much I want to be with her and what plans I have in my mind for a better life. My cousin read this shit and she told me ""Will you marry me?"" - I said inside of myself that if it can't bend her nothing will.During the year change I prayed to god Jesus and Holy Mary for her. To protect her and keep her alright. I thought that she is dead or in deep crisis or in a melancholic state.Yesterday my brother called me. She called him out of the blue. She told him that she is at the same city that I am now since X-mas... That she is still with him and she is planning to travel to my homeplace at a date near my brother's birthday. She is moving now to a new house with her ""boy-toy"" and that she shall continue her studies and stay with him. Nice. Masterpiece.She also said; ""I shall call your brother at a later stage and talk to him"". Oh really??? After all these things happened? Seriously?Unfortunately for her I am out of this game. I'm sick and tired. I am tired of trying to find a person who's disappearing for months randomly. I am tired of loving someone that is telling me that she wants to abandon her misery crying into my arms and complaining about her pointless life with him but with no will or power to finish this kind of destruction like I did with my ex. She has sentenced her own self to eternal misery. I'm out. Besides that I have changed my phonenumber. She had her chances and opportunities to save herself 4 years now. I tried my very best. I've been waiting looking for her trying for her doing the very best of me for her until today. There is nothing else to be done at this stage and probably never again.I love her so much. But I also have self-respect and dignity to my own self. Recovery shall take long time I am absolutely sure about this. But there is no other way. I have to deal with it no matter what.I feel so dead inside. But... I have to go. It's over."
tuntematon-ilmatila#blue        "In a few days I am heading back to the place that I left full of sadness and wreckage. Luckily this shall last only a few days. Then I shall be back to the ""cage"" where I shall belong for the rest 8 months of my life. What remained is just an empty flat dozens of dead memories a pile of shitty reactions and explosions and a black feeling that seems to fade away at a dead-slow pace after all...I returned back to my ""old habits"" that I left behind since 2005. I met a girl online who has serious health and mobility issues. Despite her problems she is withstanding everything trying to find a way to get away out of the same pinhole that she is trapped like me. The only difference is just that she wants to go to a country that is a neighbour comparing to mine. There are many triumphs that she has to accomplish in addition to multiple surgeries and physiotherapy sessions after that... Until the meeting point it's a warm online relationship that is interesting and soothing throughout these difficulties that I am heading to.There is a questionable interest by another girl who's nice and funny as a friend. But she is only up to temporary relationships and perhaps casual sex. I am not interested into this. Maybe I should consider this seriously. But I am not intending to use balsams nor balms to feel just happy for a few moments and then... what? Probably I shall visit her just for a cup of coffee and some nice chat though. This is okay as a matter of fact.There was also another situation that led to ""friendzoning"" here at the cage. I left it aside like many other similar cases.Few days ago I was stuck in Africa for 2 days regarding my duties. It was a really strange scenario plus a partially agonizing situation. Eventually everything was resolved without any further issues. At least I got some nice pictures and a few gifts too.Sometimes a big questionmark is hovering above my head regarding my future up to the skies. Also I am wondering why am I dealing myself to a girl that has serious health issues like my ex-girlfriend. I am constantly thinking that I am flying again around uncharted airspace. Just like the title of this page. I am trying my very best to be stabilized and secured the best way that I can. Besides it's also important to gain some extra money to keep as a backup in case of every scenario needed to participate or resolve in a way from now on...En garde..."

yksin-ii#blue   "Few days ago I travelled back to my homeplace. I had a strange but simultaneously intriguing idea to send SMS to this girl whom I last saw with my cousin and her friends just couple of days before my trip abroads. I told her that I do have a gift for her and we should meet for a coffee. She agreed immediately that was bit strange for me since this last month she didn't give to me any signs of life.So we met at a coffee place. From the very first moment that we sat down she was staring at me right through my eyes except that precise moment that she was describing me the loss of her father. All this meeting was very intense. After an hour we were holding hands to each other. She told me almost everything. That she was in love with a guy in Germany and she wanted to take revenge on him. That she is really worried about her extra weight that she has gained. That she wants to finish her studies. That she is waiting for an answer from her latest interview for work. That she has some bipolar issues that she is treating as necessary. I told her that I like her and i can't hide it. She replied to me ""let's take this at a slow pace"". All these things followed a long period of offering advice from my side on how she will become better and deal with all her problems.After some hours we left. While walking on the street she was explaining to me how to get a taxi from that place. I told her that I can manage. I hugged her then kissed her on her lips then hugged her again. We said goodbye. I walked home on foot completely lost in thoughts. After few hours I had to fly back due to duty...Now I am here thinking about her. I don't know why but I do feel a kind of ""hypotonic"" feeling. I am curious to find out what shall happen from now on regarding this case.One important note; I decided to go away regarding this situation with the girl who had mobility problems. She told me that she felt pressure regarding my messages. I apologized kindly and decided to leave it as is. Probably she is talking to somebody else or she is too sick to deal with this. I thought that it's good to keep her company since she is all the time alone at home. Who knows...Let's see what future shall reveal..."
alkanut-tai-kuollut%3f#blue     "Hm... this is interesting but even more questionmarks are popping up inside my head...Two days ago I sent her an sms regarding the diet specialist she wanted to attend. She replied to me by giving to me her skype address plus; ""Thank you but I don't know if i shall go eventually. Be well"". I told her to send me a message or call me in skype whenever she wants followed by an email regarding what happened my feelings and emotions in a good detail plus a picture of mine since i kissed her. No reply. Today I sent her the greatest news regarding my job (that from now on we will have 20 days duty and 8-10 days off at home applicable on 25th of March). She sent me a skype message that she is all the time outdoors that my news are very good and that when I shall be back in my homeplace to send her a message to go out and talk. She also asked me to bring some hand cremes for her friend if possible. Her words were very short. She didn't even give me a clue or a hint what the hell is going on.I hope this discussion shall not be in a mode ""I do see you as a friend and bla bla bla..."". On this occasion I shall be completely unpredictable.So the question... Has it started or died instead?Coming up soon..."
pimeä-yö...#blue        Another quiet and dark night at the base. Listening to some dream trance/progressive trance to manage all these feelings that are conquering me at the moment. Some minutes ago I visited a colleague's room and smoked a few cigarettes. I feel agony regarding what shall happen with her. Time is passing by too slowly it feels like it's stopped. My cousin is saying horrible words about her and I truly wonder why. I already asked her but I got no answer. I can see her online in skype but she is not saying a word not even hello how are you. I am wondering into the dark. Into this dark night in the middle of nowhere. Fuck...
oikein-ennuste...#blue  "This week was fine. 6 days back at home. Travelled to my homeplace and relaxed a little bit. I sent her a message; ""I have a suggestion for you; I can cook something that you like we can eat and then go out for a drink or coffee"". She told me that her cousins are there and she can't come today. I proposed her regarding a coffee near her home so that she didn't need to go away from her cousins for a long time. She told me ""I can't today I shall send you a message about this"". I told her that on 2nd I am leaving back to my Ops. As I predicted her message never came...My cousin told me something wise. ""If what you are living is not a two-way situation fuck it. If you have to think when you should send a message and why she didn't send any fuck it. When two people like and want each other be sure that there are no words such as ""if""...So this story has ended unfortunately with just a kiss and a disappearance. Cat-woman is busy now using her whiplash... Batman has disappeared in the shadows under a pitch-black night..."
%3f!%3f!%3f#blue        "Yesterday while transiting at a nearby airport near my homeplace I called a friend of her who asked me for a specific handcream that is hard to find elsewhere that I bought it and I shall give it to her. After a few minutes a message came from ""the person"" saying ""I heard that you are coming. I want to meet you we need to talk kisses..."" I replied to her that my offer to cook a meal and eat at my place and afterwards we could go out for a drink was still valid. She told me ""I prefer to have a coffee instead"" Where? There? Roger copy that.In some minutes we shall meet at a cafeteria near her house.Yea... right. After so many days of disappearance plus the fact that she used stupid excuses not the fact that I called her friend to offer her gift triggered her to call me... great. Just great. Bullshit at it's prime time. I am considering seriously the idea to end this nonsense before it gets out of control. I've had enough. I shall try to do it gently with a touch of velvet and silk. I hope she won't trigger my nerves and patience. Sogoku's Zen activated...Besides there is another person that I like at this stage. No title today. Just nonsense... Let's see what the hell shall happen today."
sekaisuus#blue  "The more I am walking the messier it becomes...People say that your guilts are following you everywhere like shadows in the dark. I have made a choice to remove many people from my life including my girlfriend who was a part of my life since 10th of July 2012. Also many people that were pretending to be my friends (or they were actually my friends but in a wrong way and approach - same thing sums up as an end). The reason why I eventually removed her was that she followed the pathway that my ""friends"" believed too. All done all gone. It doesn't matter anymore. There is no point on looking back. Besides... they didn't even believe that I would be back in the skies. And the ones who did wanted to take advantage from this. Touche. Queen is down. Soldiers are down. King's alone. For now.It's been a bit more than one year since I broke up with her. Actually 13 months. She was saying many bad things including this; ""After me chaos will come"". I think it's time to prove her wrong on this too.I am alone in a fucking hotel in the middle of fucking nowhere. This time inside of a city. But who cares. Makes no difference after all.One of my colleagues is seriously sick. I saw her picture from the hospital and I burst out of tears. Despite our differences she didn't deserve to live that. She is dominant during her work. Too dominant at times. But she was one of my best holding my line during last year in that fucking base there. There is a possibility that she shall never come back to work again. Shit. This is too much.I am in love with one girl who came to us during February. It started as a cliche. Met each other flew together took her to dinner twice. During the last night at the previous base i was staying in her room until early morning. She gave me a box of cookies to keep with me during my flights back. Since then we are just texting each other. I miss her so much. I have told her one million things. Actually I have bombarded her. Her answers are smiles. She also told me ""I don't know what to say"". Today she called me ""sweet fruit"". Slowly slowly she is bending. I am sure that something really dark was or is happening at the backstage.There are also some few more girls that are hovering around. But I took the decision just to keep it in friendly matters. No more.Besides... maybe my ex was right. I am hell of a deep in chaos. But okay. It's fixable. I suppose.En garde..."
tuhjassa-huoneessa#blue "Shit...This morning I was supposed to be Positioned to another base. This was something that I personally organized so that I could see her... I arranged an early morning bus. The bus never came. I had to deal with the company to provide me a train trip so I had to change 2 trains to reach that place. The first segment was also really delayed. I had to change using the upcoming route which was also delayed by 30 mins... Eventually I managed to do a 300km distance in more that 8 hours...I went at her room. She came RIGHT BEHIND ME. I was stunned. She asked me ""what are you doing here"". We went to her room. I hugged her. She was short and brief. She asked me the same question over and over. I burst out in laughter. I was pissed off so much that it turned into a laughter. HOW THE FUCK are you asking me such question since we are talking for more than 2 months straight knowing all my feelings and you have no FUCKING clue why the FUCK I am here?I gave her my gift. A heart-shaped pendant. She accepted it and told me thank you. Then she told me ""Let's go and get some food"". We went downstairs and got some food. I told her that I came for her. She didn't say a word. She told me that she was planning to tide up her room and fall asleep. She sent me msg to meet during afternoon. We went for coffee and food at the city. We had casual chat similar to the one when I first met her. But nothing special. We went back at the hotel. The elevator was packed full of people inside. I kissed her on the forehead for goodnight. She told me that she will write to me if she is awake.Tomorrow my last day the day after tomorrow flying back home for a week.I am now in my empty room wondering what the FUCK happened and how the FUCK shall I manage to remove all my feelings for her.Goddammit..."
unelmani...#blue        "Back to the base since 12th of May. These days were pretty warm to hot mixed with plenty of rain and thunderstorms too.I am now listening to Aurosonic. I never expected that after PPK there could be another band that would perform some dream trance/dream dance music better than them. Haha. THERE IS. And I was surprisingly amazed. Their music is beyond imagination. My soul is healing when I'm listening to them. Especially when travelling somewhere by train or plane...I am in love with a black girl. It's the very first time that's happening to me. No offence nor any direction or racism towards black people. It's just it never happened to me before. Her beauty is magnetic. She is a newcomer here...She is a tough nut despite her age. She had a boyfriend who treated her in a bad way. She was pretty much pissed about it. I have a feeling that this might be a tough obstacle towards my way to be with her.We went altogether plus some other colleagues walking around the city. Today I went out with her just the two of us. We went to an Italian restaurant. Definitely I paid for everything. She was surprised. She told me next time she shall pay. I agreed with her since she was so strict about it...We were walking back to the hotel telling her stories from my crazy childhood. She was laughing a lot. Every time we are going together we are laughing like small kids. Sometimes we are both trolling each other. Our mottos are ""Dead Frog"" and ""Drugs"". She is laughing like crazy when I am telling these two phrases. Sometimes she is even slapping me or pushing me really hard when I am trolling her too much. She is a badass. But she is also apologizing about this. Well...I don't know what my next steps should be. I can't sleep right now. We were texting each other some minutes ago. She was trolling me not to dream about her :PWell... Let's see what wheel of fortune shall reveal regarding this case. Seems a tough one. Do or do not. There is no try..."

väsynyt...#blue "She sent me a message that she needed help regarding her luggage towards the train station. I met her and helped her. We had several discussions about things. Few hours ago she asked me at the reception in front of everyone if my messages to her had a ""different"" meaning. Of course I told her not to take them in a bad way (what the hell should I say in front of everyone...)...When we reached the train station I helped her with everything. I also borrowed her 20 euros since her train was leaving very soon. She was asking my bank account etc. I told her ""No goodbyes. Until we meet again"".When she boarded the train I gave her a silver heart-shaped pendant. I told her again same thing ""Until We Meet Again""...She was sending me messages afterwards telling me the same question. I answered to her ""Why do you have to put signs and placards when someone cares about you?"" She was telling me ""I don't deserve your gift""... I told her ""never say such things again whenever you want talk to me I'm here"".One part of myself is missing her. But... I don't think there's much I can do. It depends now on her... After we meet again. But I suppose it won't happen soon...Tomorrow I am going back home. I am tired. Mostly mentally and emotionally. I am thinking the idea of buying a huge bottle of Bacardi and make 2lt of Mojito in a bucket full of ice plus a huge Cuban cigar. Then visit the closest beach nearby and live like a Football Manager... Fuck everything I'm out..."
kaaos-tai-rauha%3f#blue "It has been long time since my last message in a bottle. I have been battling myself into a stormy relationship which is still active.I am walking around the edge again. I found a new place in the skies right now around Scandic skies. My life is stormy and restless most of the time.There's a new girl who appeared in my life like a bomb falling from the skies. She was a newcomer and had an interest in me. At first I didn't pay that much attention since she was extremely pretty thinking inside of myself ""this level is just impossible"". Yet despite the fact that there are so many handsome men around me she chose to approach me instead. This was highlighted during a phase where we had a funny discussion with a colleague regarding who's gonna keep extra water she replied to him ""g"" is going to give me. I was stunned. That was purely unexpected.We had our first date under the radar 3 days ago. She was dressed like a charm. Blue trousers and white top which was marking her beauty but without being exposed. Just the way I adore. It was just like she was reading my thoughts.We visited the local mall she was intrigued by handbags. Then walking around the place taking a bunch of photos. While we were walking together I was telling her few stuff from my personal life. She was very aggressive regarding emotions and relationships. Her bias was very aggressive against such talks. I decided to move away regarding such subjects. I was merely shocked by that reaction. I was also shocked by her physical reaction grabbing my arm and squeezing it while she was talking about a person who made her life like hell. It was a normal reaction yet unexpected for a first date. I can't say that I didn't like. I was intrigued by that. Maybe I am a perv who knows haha ^^ - Finally we reached a bistro. I paid everything despite the fact that she was worried about the price. We had enormous conversations regarding extraordinary aspects like space travel aliens parallel universes teleportation etc. - Interesting. But still more interesting the fact that she was looking at me all the time playing with her hair unstoppably. Still her signals are mixed. It feels like she is trying to hide the fact that she likes me. But again I am confused a bit since she was changing these signs at times.We came back she wanted to buy few stuff at a local supermarket. That place didn't accept cash so I paid her stuff by card it wasn't a big deal. She was telling me all the time about giving me the money back etc. - I told her ""I wish in life that our only problems would be these ones"".We went back. While we were in the lift she was looking like a miracle. I resisted myself not to kiss her. I said goodbye by hugging her and promised to each other a new date at a later stage.These days we only texted each other our schedules are literally opposite for the time being. I am waiting for her reply regarding a meeting during Thursday.It's the very first time that I am dealing with such situation. As always I am playing with fire again. This time it's far worse than expected. Maybe it's a sign to end my current relationship immediately. Or it's just another failure in the end.Finally chaos or peace shall prevail? Let's see..."
das-virus#blue  Same conclusion. She just answered that she is already walking around the city that she didn't see my messages and that she didn't manage to answer my call. Haha. Very funny. DELETE. I am also planning to delete/block her phonenumber too. There is no point on wasting more time.I am alone in my homeplace fighting off the heat. There is a curvy girl at a clothes store who's really interesting. Despite the fact that she is short she was wearing a red dress... holy s%^t she was hot like fire! I've seen her 4 times since last june usually she was wearing shorts and a T-Shirt but now... mmm... interesting... I proposed her for a coffee when I'll have more time (a small excuse to keep her on fire ^^) she agreed about that... mmm... more interesting...For the time being I am keeping myself away from this hell. It's a strong temptation to keep myself away from this place...
vapaa-tila#blue At last silence. She decided to stop nagging / sending messages. Finally I suppose she got the message from my side.There are two interesting girls one working in a clothes shop and another one working in a small supermarket. The first one is really curvy and sexy. Second one is slim and rather tall a bit shadowy and introvert. I am still in question-mark which one should I choose to proceed with the approach. Besides I shall be away from the base until 27th so this is getting really interesting ^^I have thought also 2 scenarios I shall decide during the day (or not haha ^^)

No more dumbhead(s) publishing idiotic pictures under coconut trees and shit ^^ Fv*# YEAH!I know that originally I am coming from a hot country with millions of islands etc. etc. etc. - SUMMER IS OVER B1cH3ZzZzZ ! ! !Lying under the blankets when it's raining/snowing/icestorming outside. Long and cold nights under clear skies. Hot blueberry tea/coffee/hot chocolate with cognac while watching epic series like Fringe/Lord Of The Rings/The Hobbit... YEAH!I have been waiting this F&^$#@G winter so long. Ah yes. Halloween is coming!!! Forgot it completely!I am now resting at last hoping that this was my last rotation. It's been 4 months already. I think it's time to relax a bit.Definitely planning to learn German this time and master my knowledge in Finnish too. I think I might take an exam for a degree regarding the second one.GF sucks. I think I should break up ASAP. It's the very first time of my life that I am considering the idea of a ""relaxed relationship"". I am too tired of commitment/fighting for bullshit reasons/arguing/improving their life. I think it's an initial mistake of mine that needs an urgent correction and reassessment too.There is still this girl working in this clothes' shop nearby. I think she's the perfect choice for that. Funny confident and easy to handle. No complaints despite the fact that I am seeing her once per month. I am 1000% sure that she has a relationship and still wants to go out with me - this time she is eager regarding offering a drink (!)I am not planning anything yet. I am too tired of planning anymore. Just initiate my personal scenarios. Regarding girls... I'll be relaxed this time."
kadun-lopussa#blue      "After a night full of fights and arguments about fundamental stuff regarding a relationship she was pushing the ""eject"" button indirectly. I gave her time up to midnight to finalize her decision and rethink what the fuck I have been for her up to date.It's over. I don't believe that something shall change anymore. After 1 year and 3 months I do have to reconsider my life as a solo entity.Happy fucking autumn. 21st of September.I think I have done a proper mental and timely preparation for this impact to come. Sad and bitter truth.It's time to organize a trip for myself. I feel so fucked up. The good side of the story is that it's not the first time that I have to deal with this shit.Now she is sending me messages. Fuck my life..."
nahdään-huomenna#blue   During the final days I felt that I have to go home and surpass all shit with a black heart. I was fucking right I came back home and found everything painted black. Tremendous fights with my girlfriend the feeling of her supporting everybody turning me into a wrestling sack fucks me up. She is even supporting complete strangers in a way that her sisters won't be dissapointed. SO FUCKING WHAT?!I am fucking fed up of this shit. I sent a huge message that I want to be completely alone after finishing with all the businesses fixing up my home. Then travel to my homeplace. This is also a heartblacking situation since the love of my life is there howling herself with the heritage that her boy-toy got. It's tremendously amazing how someone can withstand eating shit with a shovel just by expecting her boyfriend to obtain probably 200k. I would definitely kill myself if I had to do that. Definitely without any doubts.The good side of the story is that soon I shall travel back to Finland for a few days to feel the cold merging with the black ice of my life. Like I said in the past winter is also a passage that is prevailing through the upcoming spring...So see you tomorrow. During my trips to ice cold and snow. FUCK YEA!
ymmärsin#blue   "Phase 2; the toughest one. I woke up really early in the morning. First thing to do is pack all her shitty stuff and set them aside to be given ASAP. At around 10am she called after a week. Definitely I didn't answer I am following her own words letter by letter ""there is nothing else to talk about"". Yet she is calling me again. I don't get this concept. Why should I? This is the house of the rising sun. Because I can. Pure nonsense...I can't believe that despite the fact that she was not living here all her shit fitted 2 full large suitcases plus 2 extra bags. What the fuck?! I found ALL her gifts. ALL her letters. ALL her clothes. Every single fucking thing that has connection to her.My initial plan is to travel to my homeplace for as long as the hell I want to. Then come back to my house call her and give her back everything. Then get the fuck outta here and travel to Finland. At last. After 2 fucking years I shall go back to my roots. My Finnish teacher wished me the best regarding Finland and why not find a blonde blue eyed Finn girl get married and have 5-6 kids. Tietysti ^^As the title said I understood. Definitely I am going out tonight drinking black beer listening to rock/metal music and tide up my fucking inner self. Get used to being solo again. There is a nice bar playing live music not really far from my apartment. I'll pile up and enjoy. Why not?"
legendat-menneisyydestä#blue    It's truly remarkable how the ones that entered your life and loved are leaving you behind and letting you haunted with all the memories and moments with them. It's unimaginable how stubbornness can reach to a point that everything ends and these people become complete strangers despite the fact that you shared some of your deepest and strongest feelings. The feeling is similar to leaving treasure boxes scattered around that might be opened one day as a remembrance or left behind forever.My journeys shall begin tomorrow morning. Long way to go 2 different countries and back to square one. Let's see what shall happen...I feel darkness embracing me. I shall get used to this disconnection though. Eventually she will become a complete stranger. The worst part of the story is that we are breaking up because she is following what everybody told her instead of her own will.Sometimes destiny is Joker laughing loudly. Strange but sometimes it's true....
läpinäkyvät-liljat#blue Back from my homeplace. I was hoping that few days at the village would soothe this storm. Both my feelings and senses are in a chaotic state. My mood is changing drastically and dramatically. I never expected that this controlled crash landing would eventually turn to an uncontrolled one. I am applying my best efforts to keep my emotions intact and try not to do anything stupid like calling her back or going to her place.Most of her things are already given away to friends or relatives. During my previous relationship I made a promise to myself to not keep a single thing from the person I am breaking up inside my fucking house. Since she doesn't even care about them why should I?Very few of them remaining at this stage placed inside her suitcase ready to be given back. Her invisible deadline is the day that I am flying to Finland. I do have one-way ticket. I have no clue yet nor idea when I am going to come back again. I will try my very best to stay there as long as possible. There is no reason to be here anymore.All this loss has become a habit anymore. And this love was a sick scream after all...Tomorrow I am going out with a colleague for a coffee. During Sunday I am going 5 people to a colleague's cottage and enjoy some nights besides the fireplace drinking some fine wine and disconnecting from reality.Then my trip to Finland becomes imminent. The time is near. After 2 years at last I am going back to where everything started...
hylky#blue      "I am not quite sure about the exact day that we broke up. Was it during our last talk on the phone while I was visiting my cousin or by the last message saying ""there is nothing more to say between us"" (?!?!?) - Definitely I can't figure this out in a clear way.Anyway it's been approximately a month since the last time I had any news from her. I have no idea whether she is at her homeplace or here. I also have no clue if she is working at her previous boss who was probably the biggest jerk ever. I can't even understand the level of her self-destruction attitude and her low self-esteem by going back for the 3rd time (!!!) to a job that caused to her all her health problems up to today. I don't get it.Anyway what's making me grind my gears is the fact that she didn't even care to take her stuff from my house including her old cellphone and a flash drive that has all her exercises regarding her previous studies. How the fuck is that possible?! I already know that she has no copies nor any cloud backup since her laptop was completely dead in my hands-she threw a full glass of cola on the keyboard... shit....My feelings are also a complete wreckage. I postponed my trip to Finland for 20 days since I wanted to chill out a bit more. I am also thinking the idea of giving her last things back including her cabin bag at her home just ring the bell salute her as an aviator and just turn my back. Besides the following morning I shall be airborne...I am trying my very best to be patient up to that day. There are no interesting girls around these days. Maybe some colleagues but no I don't like the idea of mixing it in any case.I don't know. Maybe I will wait and see where the wreckage shall be thrown by the river of life..."
paranormaalinen-toiminta#blue   "At last I managed to find a friend who was ""absent"" and ""missing"" for more than 2 months. His father died during that time and he was involved to a married woman who had a child... ONLINE! Anyway he was brave enough to admit his ""fall"" and asked for help. He is a different person I was astonished by the result of his therapist...Guess what... He went to the shop that my ex is working right now by accident/mistake (the one that she was working for more than 10 years destroying her health 3 times for nothing...) - He had no idea that she was back there. The story was briefly something like this;-How are you? -Not good these things happened to my life I feel very sad but I am trying. -Where is your friend? -Even if you don't believe me it's been more than 2 months since the last time that I saw him (which was true). -I sent him a message (she didn't even tell him that she wrote to me ""there is nothing more to say nor discuss anymore"") I called him twice he didn't answer so I let it go I am not going to hunt him down. Then she was telling him about a friend of her who had a relationship with a married guy for 8 (!goddammit!) fucking years and that you should continue with her (REALLY?!!? with a WOMAN WHO'S FUCKING MARRIED WITH A CHILD?!?! FUCKING SERIOUSLY?!?!) and that you never know what would have happened...She also told him to come this Friday to give him back my stuff...WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK? ONE FUCKING MONTH OF ABSENCE WHILE SHE WAS TELLING ME THAT SHE LOVES ME AND BULLSHIT LIKE THIS SHE DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING TELL ME WHEN SHE IS COMING BACK FROM HER HOMEPLACE SHE GOT THE JOB IN THIS FUCKING BORDELLO SHOP SHE WAS EVEN FUCKING HIDING THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THE MESSAGE AND EVENTUALLY THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF HER FUCKING LOVE FOR ME!?!?!? REALLY???!? MAYBE AM I THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE RUNNING TOWARDS TO HER FEET AND LICKING THEM RIGHT NOW?!!?!? FOR FUCKING GOD'S SAKE!!!I was so MAD that she was telling him such FUCKING BULLSHIT. SHE DOESN'T RESPECT WHAT WE HAD OK. SHE DOESN'T RESPECT ME OK. SHE DOESN'T RESPECT HER FUCKING LIFE BY CHOOSING THE SHITTIEST WAY DEGRADING HER OWN FUCKING SELF. OK. SHE DIDN'T EVEN RESPECT THE FACT THAT HER LIFE WAS SAVED WHEN I SAW THAT HER EYES TURNED YELLOW AND SENT HER FOR FULL MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS (initially I thought it was liver damage I was partially right it was her gallbladder plus many more shit including a self-immune disease) OK. SHE DIDN'T EVEN RESPECT MY FUCKING FRIEND WHO HAD ALL THESE PROBLEMS AND STRUGGLING WITH HIS OWN SELF TELLING HIM F U C K I N G B U L L S H I T KNOWING THAT I WOULD EVENTUALLY KNOW.NOW I KNOW. I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT THE FUCK SHOULD I DO.On Friday she is expecting my friend to come instead she will see me and find out that the door is not just closed but LOCKED FOREVER and the FUCKING KEY WILL BE THROWN TO THE LIONS AND CROCODILES...Better late than ever. Now I see who you are. The time has come.I am expecting a really brutal end of this circle. No violence. No fights. Nothing. Just go there give her fucking stuff take back all what I have given to her (gifts for sure since she has nothing personal nor nothing that I really need) and just leave silently throwing the bomb that I have one way ticket to a faraway land (which is also true). A nice ""defensive grenade"" that will blow up exactly during the moment of glory. And definitely I will never ever look back.The end is near. The tide has already been sentenced. This paranormal activity has to end. Forever."
mitä-muuta-rakastaa%3f#blue     Are we actually here?Has it come to this?You’ve thrown me in the deep endAre you leaving me behind?‘Cause I’ve mapped the worldOut with our lovePlanned a life involving youNow you say I’m not enoughForget about the noiseJust listen to my voiceIf we let this goWhat else is there to love?If we let this goWill we ever know?
elämäni-tulessa#blue    One more circle is about to be completed. This night feels really strange. It's also the very first time during this autumn that my house feels completely empty and cold. I am totally stuck in listening Aurosonic non stop. I am preparing myself mentally and emotionally to face her in a few hours at her bordello working place but this time to end it up for the 3rd time which shall be the catalytic and final one. I have also some extra scenarios in my brain to travel back to my homeland but this time by ship. I want to disconnect completely from what's about to happen tomorrow. I was thinking also the idea of travelling to visit a friend from the army in the western part of the country. Maybe I will end up also in Italy. I have no definite plan it depends on my mood that shall be determined from what kind of storm I shall face.Everything's packed and ready. I feel chilled betrayed and most of all ruined. I truly wonder what fucking person did I have in my life these 18 months. Soon my birthday is coming back. I have no clue where I shall be during that time.Fuck. I never expected that this piece of shitty wreckage would be so tough to deal with. By flipping a coin first side is telling me that it will be rough as hell. Other side is telling me that it will be a typical procedure which will eventually end up in very bad emotions that will remain unshown and silent after all.Again what destiny shall reveal?
tuskani-jatkuu...#blue  Fuck. I sent a message some minutes ago that I am going to meet her some meters away from this bordello shop and she replied to me that her shift is over and that she has already left. She also told me that she will send me a message when she is almost done to come and get my stuff.I feel like a knife is crunching by spinning inside my heart. It hurts like hell. This comedy-parody-tragedy has come to such extent that is unbearable and intolerable.This night shall be a nightmare. I was hoping that this shit would be over now and eventually find some peace inside of me. This is way too much even for me dammit...
viimeinen-päivä#blue    I was thinking about my initial plan to postpone this shit up to Dec. 16th the very last night before I am gone to the north. I was thinking to send her a message about this. But on the other hand I am also thinking to wait for her message to end it as soon as possible... I am going to flip a coin. Heads I am doing it now. Tails on 16th.Tails... shit.
pettäminen#blue "Coin was correct I shouldn't have gone there. I betrayed my own destiny to find out what the hell would happen.The answer was that I wasted nearly 3 months of my life by arguing over and over again about the same shit as always.The final strike came when she told me ""I lost this wedding this bachelor party this event etc. because of you"". This flipped over my f... mind. It was a sudden death an instant kill of all my feelings for her up to today.I told her ""are these your last words?"" She said yes and verified them 3 times. I just left her to take all her shit away and get the fuck out of my house.All her life just rotated around pure bullshit. Some fucking cheap excuses to cover her own shithole.I am in blame for offering her a second chance. I should have followed what my destiny told me not to involve with her when i tossed that coin.Anyway. It's over. 19 months were just pure nonsense from my fucking life.Tomorrow it's a new day. I shall change my phonenumber plus throw away to the recycle bin all the crap that she gave to me during these last 3 months. I am also waiting for some friends to give away some more stuff that i don't want to throw away to their kids/siblings etc.The dawn of a new day. Without her. Free at last..."
stargazer#blue  Where is your star?Is it far is it far is it far?When do we leave?Hey I believe I believe...Where was your star?Was it far was it farWhen did we leave?We believed we believed we believed...Ooh now where do we go? I feel terribly bad inside of me at the moment. Mixed feelings of anger sadness melancholy grief and nostalgia are watercolours diluting deeply in my heart...Breaking up is equal to a small death. Each loss is curable but unbearable during these first days of separation. I miss her but simultaneously i know very well that it's much much better without her. Besides there was no hope and no future for us. She was too attached to her own personal pleasure and nonsense in her shallow life.All signs were obvious that this fairytale would turn to a walking nightmare...Every night that I am alone at home I am sinking into these feelings...Eventually it will also fade away. Like clouds diluting to clear skies. Until then where do we go....................
rakkaus-on-lumivalkoinen...#blue        I had some friends visiting me at home for 3 consecutive days. It was a small relief regarding my sadness during these tough days of mine...Everyone left some hours ago. I still feel really bad. I feel like poisoned betrayed regarding my initial decision to avoid any further interaction and complications with her...Tomorrow it's training day. I need to gather all my forces and patch myself up to handle these consecutive 4 days to come. It's going to be really tough this time. It's the 4th time in a row that such situation is occurring again. Breaking up and consecutive training in just few days without almost no recovery at all...Let's see what destiny shall reveal for me...Love is white like snow. And burning me up that way too...
surun-aihe#blue All differences and a final absence... both feelings are so intense I think I am losing my mind at times...I was discussing my personal story with a colleague and my cousin both of them agreed that disrespect plus the fact that I cannot accept that she was with me just to enjoy her life without thinking seriously about her relationship was the key point to this disaster...Sad to admit that both of them are right. She was completely inappropriate and incompatible to my own mentality and target in life regarding a relationship that would eventually lead to something serious instead of just having a good time. The greatest proof was that she was not eager to follow me wherever I go or whatever I do...A black aurora is hovering above my head. 20 lost months from my life. Again so many promises and letters from her side that were just words of the moment...Separation is the final outcome. All is lost. I have to move on...So hard to accomplish so hard to believe it was all for nothing...
sydämeni-kuin-hauta...#blue     It was a busy day... mixed and a bit complicated too...Sad things first I was walking on the street listening to melodic death metal I tried to avoid all uphill ways and eventually I passed few meters away from the fucking shop that she is working... My heart was really heavy and I tried to pass away by not looking behind as fast as possible. Few days ago I was walking these streets heading home and waiting for her to eat together and sleep hugged to each other...This belongs to the past forever. Today I also gave away some of her last things that she left behind. Last items remaining are a pair of earrings her heart-shaped pyjamas a pair of 4GB USB Drives with her Uni essays/exams/notes etc. and a piece of Delsey Cabin Luggage that she bought to me as a gift for my flights...I really want to set everything on fire. I am holding myself not to burn them up in the middle of the night... I know that very soon she is finishing her job probably she might see it happening... But I won't offer her that pleasure...I will remain in the dark. It's almost spring outdoors but my heart is frozen like a stone... Similar to a grave that our dead love will never rise again... My pale morning star lost forever...Everything's black. Like a black hole consuming me...I am trying so hard to withstand these black feelings but hopefully I am facing the storm by staring into it's eyes steadily and forcefully...Wasn't worth it after all...Fuck damn shit...
ikuinen-talvi#blue      Despite the fact that's the first day of spring in my heart there's still the feeling of a deep and eternal winter... I broke up I am alone and I am probably going to be alone for a long time...In my heart there's a blizzardstorm and a snowstorm that's cutting me deeply to the bone...
tunnoton%2flopussa#blue A bit more than a month away from you. The whole sensation is completely numb inside my heart anymore...At times it hurts. At times I am thinking all our wonderful moments yet shall never come.Definitely it's a trap. It's a trick of the mind that's always letting aside the sad moments and keeping the good ones...Also quarantined. I don't even care anymore about it. Everything's so fucked up I am tired of thinking anymore.Probably I lost my job. I am stranded in a really fucking place a really fucking city a really fucking country...This is the boulevard of broken dreams. Full of shattered glass full of poison darkness and solitude.Listening to trap music now. In the end... It doesn't matter...
kiinnitetty#blue        "What was the meaning of our story indeed? What was the purpose of this journey? How nonsense things made it up in a way that whole thing was literally pinned down twice? Why am I fighting this anymore since it ended and obviously the final words of abandonment came out from her mouth... twice?I am seeing really weird dreams involving her. Dark nights crescent moon Southern direction winds blowing high altitude clouds and African dust covering the horizon which is really hard to see and her face into my thoughts... I woke up in a melancholic scent how everything got so f... up. Did really everything had to do with her ""personal freedom"" or was it something deeper?Women's hearts sometimes are the hardest of all mysteries into this world. Even Einstein who was one of the greatest scientists couldn't find a solution to this riddle. But the greatest mystery right now is why am I still loving her? Why am I still hoping regarding some extra time into a match that has already ended more than a month ago? Why am I even thinking of making an attempt again in a relationship that failed twice the hardest way?Maybe I should think even more about the mystery that's colliding upon myself. Probably this is even worse than Einstein's riddle...My head is still looking down. Looks like following days will be even tougher though..."
jossakin-jonne-kuulun#blue      Pitch dark. Music from the past is echoing in my ears. My eyes are completely closed. Trying to disconnect. Thousands of memories are passing by through my eyes rolling like a never-ending movie. Past situations moments of loneliness promising loves that now do not exist. Echoes of the past laying in the dark...Trying to put all pieces of myself in order to reassemble. This previous blast was catalytic to my brains and existence up to today. It hurts so much similar to an explosion from a defensive-type grenade thrown out of her hands. I feel guilty why I allowed this degradation upon myself...Suddenly music changes to Linkin Park. So assertive to exist. A new remix blending the power of destruction and the hyper-efforts I am now performing to surpass these obstacles at the moment. Both hopeful and hopeless feelings are balancing into this thin rope which is on fire...One more night is heading to it's end. A new day is coming.Somewhere I belong...
negatiivinen#blue       My head is fluctuating like a pendulum. Don't know how to keep myself in cold blood and take it easy. I think this is too much for me anymore.I've been in far worse situations comparing to this. Yet my resistance and resilience has reached to a rock bottom.Silence. Dread. Imprisonment. Defiance. Solitude. Darkness.Can't handle it anymore.I really hope that I am not getting crazy. I really hope that these are just games of my mind to keep me up into this chaos.I hope I am not the eliminated one after all...
kaleidoscope#blue       Every night I am seeing horrible nightmares in my sleep. My sleeping pattern has been a pure havoc these days. Hundreds of memories and moments that will never exist again. I have all curtains closed. Every time that I am going out to buy some food or do something important I am wearing a face pretending that I am smiling but inside of me I am screaming so loudly that all glasses are shattering in my brain...Waiting patiently for the day that I shall leave from here and never come back. Only in moments of transitioning anymore...I am closing my eyes trying to gather some energy from this echo of silence. I still can't get over it...
karjala#blue    "Listening to pure melodic death metal nonstop. Many old ""friends"" published some really nice and soothing music that hits rock bottom.Definitely I won this battle. But at what cost?Better days are coming at last. Some sunlight enlightening my darkest hours in here. It seems that in a few days my time shall come to get the hell out of here towards my homeplace...This distance still hurts but I think that the peak of this pain is fading away. Fading to black anyway since it's lost forever.I went for some training after 44 consecutive days locked up in my f... apartment. My physical strength and stamina are at least 75% less than it used to be. Gathering my shattered glasses upon this place. Still in pain still in vain but hope is the last to die in here.I am slowly getting used to my loneliness and the fact that this is over once for good. That shall be tidied to the library of the past and eventually stay there.Everything has it's price. Everything has a value and eventually a trade for..."
painajainen-on-palannut...#blue After some days of absence I came back.Days are generally quiet finalizing my own obligations so that I can leave as soon as possible to my homeplace till I am called back up to the skies...Your absence still hurts. Although I am getting used to the fact that it's over now forever...My brother came to visit me for a few days. While I was enjoying my Mojito he informed me of... the nightmare...She called him after almost a year or so she asked him how's he doin' - then sent her greetings to me and hung up the phone.[email protected]?! W0t?! I was literally stunned for at least 5 minutes to realize what the hell happened.Her boytoy inherited 200k euros. She was eating s...t for more than 15 years to achieve this objective. She finally moved with him literally in the middle of nowhere living the life(?) of her dreams(?). She threw me with her best karate chop on the ground 3 times. Ignored everything and...Now what the hell does she want? Why is she involving my brother into this?Of course she doesn't have my cell number. Nor did I allow my brother to pass it to her. Why is she stirring again the threadmill?Appeared again like a ghost almost after 2 years to tell me... what?How is her f... life? How's treating her boytoy? That she is again f... disappointed with his recklessness and laziness? Cry again on my f... shoulders? And then disappear? Again?!
viimeinen-yö#blue       Last night in the cage. Few hours remaining for my flight to my homeplace. I'll flip a coin whether I shall take her last things back to the fucking store that she is working or not. Deep inside of me a voice is telling me not to do it at all it's not worth it. Besides... She was the one who left... After going away from the cashier... The end.A new page is turning... Or not? Tomorrow's destiny shall choose...
yhden-sivun#blue        Today I decided to flip a coin regarding my destiny. Heads go to her f... shop and throw everything on her table in a bag and get the f... out. Tails do absolutely nothing - throw everything into the recycle bin and let go forever. Tails.Packed my luggage locked my flat and left. Met my brother and his fiancee. We flew altogether to my homeplace. Everything was so sad at the airport; very few people everybody wearing masks. Feels like apocalypse is about to come.First day here after more than 5 months. It feels weird. Now next plan to be executed; Take a picture at the exact spot where she was crying over my shoulders about her boy-toy and email her with a timestamp on. A friend of mine approved this move as a checkmate.Soon... Very soon....
haalistu-mustaksi#blue  At last the pain regarding my ex is finally fading away. To be precise fading to black...Today it's a big day. One picture. One mail. A hidden message. It symbolises the return of the king where he belongs to and the place where everything started with her. The place where she was crying on my shoulders. The person who's been in love with her for so many years...Fingers crossed...
varjot#blue     "Back again at my homeplace. Life is now boring waiting for the day that I will be back to the skies...Mail sent. As I expected absolute silence. What a surprise ^^ Yesterday I was reading an article about ""zombieing"" ""Ghosting"" and ""Submarining"". All these crappy behaviours coming directly from the social media. ""Submarining says a lot about that person’s lack of character and lack of respect for you."" - This is at least what most psychologists say about one more phenomenon coming from addiction or bullshitting in social media.Definitely I had some clue about it but nowadays it's becoming worse and worse with the influence of these crappy shit. For sure it's also a problematic attitude and self-esteem. Even my brother who's a friend of her for more than 15 years is angry with this behaviour as a friend.I also met by accident my ex working as a cleaner after 9 years. She changed her hair to blonde and also applied some disgusting tattoos that do denote a person who's a drug addict or a fake ""gangster""- a monochrome piece of panther crap under her palms. One more reason that I do feel grateful that I am not with her anymore. Thanks god.Some thoughts are hovering about my ex fortunately very few ones that are popping up into my brain at random moments. I feel almost sure that she will also reveal her worst self of her after we broke up and of course dig into her addictions. I just hope that I will never ever meet her too again.Hopefully soon I'll be back to the skies. Let's see what the future shall prevail for me... Until then just waiting here and wonder around like a shadow at times... "
taivas-ja-helvetti...#blue      Few hours remaining for my return to the skies. At last.I had a really crazy phonecall from a colleague who disappeared completely during the quarantine period. She asked me to come to her homeplace (!) arranged on Thursday. That was really unexpected though. Well... Final strike is about to come.Now I am listening to Black Sabbath-Heaven and Hell. A piece of legacy is at hands...I can't even believe what's happening. I also didn't expect her appearance back to the scene plus with a formal invitation included...I feel really strange. Yet it's almost about to come. See you in the next turn folks...
kylmissä-pohjoismaissa#blue     Very unstable flying days are passing by at the time. Everything is in a completely liquidised state everything can change from hour to hour from day to day and so on.I don't know what to feel anymore. The loss of my ex? The loss of my crush? The meet of my previous ex at my homeplace?I am sitting at the pool and thinking about them. How the fuck did my life become so wrecked regarding my relationships?Some of my colleagues are wondering how the fuck do I get such shitty girlfriends in my life? There is a Greek theory of the magnetic fields that you are attracted by stupid girlfriends (the malakomagnitis aka malako; stupid gf and magnitis; magnet in Greek) anyways I don't believe in such theories. It's just the majority of people do have shit in their heads (including myself - I do accept my mortality...)There are two interesting girls one from the cleaning team who has my phone number in her hands and one more here at the hotel who has also impulsed and stimulated my kinky brain...
heräsin-pimeästä-unesta#blue    Today I was lying under the sun thinking about all these bullshit that happened until today. I do understand and sense from a colleague's experience that some people are not meant to be in our lives despite our desperate efforts to keep them in our destiny and destination. One good reason could be their inability and lack of common sense to realize their priorities in their lives also their horrible belief that they can continue being in a YOLO state indefinitely until they eventually die before their time due to their negligence and loss in an eternal virtual Euphoria...These last 5 days my radars have acknowledged a new girl who's managing the pool and the spa here... She is short but oh my god I am watching her and all my inner instincts want to tear apart her clothes like a barbarian and eat her alive till she finally faints in my hands... Then repeat again and again and again...Awaken from the dark slumber I suppose...
tupakoin#blue   For the very first time in my life I felt an uncontrollable urge to smoke... I bought the same pack of cigarettes that my ex was smoking Davidoff slim black. It's the very first time in my life that I bought a full pack of cigarettes... Feels completely shit... I am now in the smoking hall of this hotel there are also few people around that I wish they were not here...It's so miserable... I was the one that was saying to my ex to quit smoking and now I am the one who's doing that.It feels really terrible I also have a sense that I want to vomit...Tomorrow probably it's my last flight here at the base. Then the future is uncertain again. No idea what shall come next...
nolla#blue      Last cigarette inside my packet. I am totally alone in the smoking room here at the lobby. She didn't call nor sent any message. My cousin explained a theory to me why women end up in terrible relationships. Well...Good guys eventually are sentenced in a way. She wished that my next one will fit like a glove...Tomorrow it's the last night at the base. Then who knows?I was watching a video about missing someone. It means that I still love.Fuck... I'll take a walk around and smoke the last one...
...plussa-kaks#blue     Two horrible dreams involving plane accidents popped up into my brains in a row. In one of them I am also saving everyone removing them from the wreckage which is set on fire...This is the last day and night at the base. I wanted to write down the outcome of the most important case with... the nightmarish girl...When I was down to my homeplace my brother met both of them at a cafe. She asked my brother why didn't he call me to come and join them.Such f... audacity from her side. I was so angry when I heard that. A friend of mine who's supporting me regarding this case told me to re-think about it since this was a smoke screen to her boyfriend and to my brother (she probably believes that he has no idea - HAHAHA he is my brother OF COURSE HE KNOWS EVERYTHING) to hide her dirt under the mattress.My brother also told me that her jerk spent all 200k in less than a year and now he is broke as f... - she is now working for 12 hours per day and paying everything including his coffee so that she won't lose this jackal (jackass) from her life. What a splendid move. Chuck Norris approves.One of my colleagues whom I recently discussed about this case told me that she is too wimp to approach the reality of her feelings and step up into something new instead she is choosing not to get away from this swamp that she's drowning in... She also told me that her behaviour was so selfish trying to fill up her f... self esteem. She claimed that not even worms are behaving in such manner and matter...Anyway when the time comes and realizes what the hell she has been doing it will be far from late for her life and destiny.Whatever...Listening to Rainbow right now. Might be one of the upcoming signs for the future to come...
